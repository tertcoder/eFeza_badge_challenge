# eFeza Super Agent Badge Generator

This project is a solution to a challenge from eFeza, implementing a web application that allows to generate custom super agent badges. The badges are created based on the information provided by the user, including their full name, super agent code, phone number, and uploaded profile picture.

## Features

- **Profile Picture Upload**: Users can upload their profile picture to be included in the badge.
- **Dynamic Badge Generation**: Badges are generated in real-time based on the provided information.
- **Downloadable Badges**: Users can download their custom super agent badges in image format.
- **UI Design with Figma**: The user interface was initially designed using Figma, ensuring a clean and intuitive design.
- **Built with Modern Technologies**: Developed using Vite.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Form Input with React Hook Form**: Utilizes React Hook Form for form validation, making it easy to implement and manage form validation logic.
